# Moonshine is now Open Source

Valiant Pixels is happy to announce that we're releasing Moonshine's graphic assets to the public, aka *OPEN SOURCE*. It will be under the CC-BY-SA Creative Commons license (the same one Google uses for their system icons).

This includes the PSD files, along with all the appropiate .PNG files that make up Moonshine.
