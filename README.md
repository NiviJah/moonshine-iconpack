# Moonshine is now Open Source

Valiant Pixels is happy to announce that we're releasing Moonshine's graphical assets to the public, aka *OPEN SOURCE*. It will be under the CC-BY-4.0 Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (the same one Google uses for their system icons).

This includes the PSD files, along with all the appropiate .PNG files that make up the Moonshine icon pack.
